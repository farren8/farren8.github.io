        <h3>march 24, 2025</h3>
        <p>i think i need to hermit for the next 3 days. oh lawd. this is the final stretch of midterms but i have been doing this for this whole term. here are the things i am looking forward to doing when i am through this:
- play stardew valley on the bus
- start writing again 
- bike to the beach
- start meditating again
- start a new book
- sit and listen to my cds
- plan the alaska trip 
- make banana bread with the one black banana in my freezer
- make my chickpea stew that i have been putting off making for the past 2 weeks

i have to pull another all nighter tonight and i am not looking forward to it. but maybe this is my last one of this term (?)... probably not tho. 
</p>
<br>
<p>florist is so beautiful. if u star people have time to listen to an album i highly recommend 'emily alone' by florist. i first listened to it in february of last year and it truly swept me up in a big ol' hug when i needed it the most. and i need it now and florist is again here and i am so grateful. i am reminded of the ocean and of love and of myself when i didn't know that much but i knew enough to know that love is the be all end all. i love u all star people and when i look up into the sky i see us all dancing, don't stop dancing!  </p>

        <p>im using my 5 minute pomodoro break to blog but i cannot think of anything that has happened to me or anything that i have been thinking. maybe i will just say this: 
love your body and your friends to the max and dont forget to wear ur retainer and jump up and down ever so often and try to catch yourself when judging because that is someones child and its so simple but when i think this i see arms around all of me and i see my arms around all of you and i really mean it when i say that love is the answer and all of this other stuff is just bullshit that will never equate to the love me and u hold.</p>

<p>ok im back it is my 2nd pomodoro break. i am studying for my calc 3 midterm and i realized a couple days ago that this is the last math midterm i will need to take in uni!! (i think). also i think i fucked up something in my github for this website and i cant push or pull to git anymore without it screaming at me. aka i cant publish this blog post. so if ur seeing this i fixed it !  </p>

        <p>3:01pm: omg star ppl i am so mfking focused im as sharp as a knife. listening to "Box Fan - Low Speed, Black Screen" on youtube rn so good tickles my brain in the right way... music is for the weak. but also maybe im the weak one cause sometimes i cannot read a sentence when i am listening to music. ok so im planning to lock in for like as long as i can, don't need sleep when i have my calculus and cpsc to hangout with. im going to update u guys on my where abouts in this journey. i keep needing to do this thing where i need to destroy my body for 3 days straight for a test because i don't pay attention in lecture. but also it is a fun game and challenge that i like to try. you know i like to push my limits to be the best me i can be. im like that yea.
ok so the main battle is my calc 200 class. i have not been going to lecture and am about 4 weeks behind in content. i have a midterm on thursday (in 6 days) and have no idea wtf is happening. first though i have to finish my coding assignment. so rn im gonna try to finish that and then i can start my calculus battle. im actually kinda excited for my calculus battle. anyways ill update u. wish me luck xx. </p>
<br>
<p>9:03pm: what da hell. i spent like 4 hours on one coding question that probably would take the average person 30 minutes. feeling burnt out and annoyed asf i dont know what to do. also coco and the book of life have the same plot and dialogue like what da hellllllll.... now im finally starting math when i should have 2 hours ago. i am a little hungry im gonna try to eat something. i have so much shit to do but not that much time. ok wait lemme do the math its 9pm rn and i can work until 11am before i crash out so i have 14 hours of math. 
my plan for right now i think is to eat / break until 9:30pm and then start my calc textbook notes which will honestly probably take me 3-4 hours ok ill just make a list (yay!): </p>
<p>
-schedule--------------------------------------
9:10pm - 9:30pm -> eat 
9:30pm - 1:00am -> textbook notes
1:00am - 3:00am -> webwork 7
3:00am - 10:00am -> textbook practice problems
10:00am - 12:00pm -> cpsc assignment finish
12:00pm -> curl up into rowan's bed
-----------------------------------------------
</p>
<br>
<p>11:14pm: i ate some eggs and toast and just finished my textbook notes!!! i am feeling a little anxious though... overthinking......</p>

        <p>11:46am - in bio class. i saw marcus macgregor td. he gave me "Found Any Shoggoths Yet?", brought up some good points but the song he recommended isn't my jam. 
5:01pm - met this girl i have met a million times before but cannot ever remember her name. then when she said it AGAIN i said 'eiko! like ecco2k!!!' and she did not get it. sad moment. i talked to my mum freaking out about my future and my major earlier td. that was fun. i am going to hangout with my new friend (??!) and it is feeling very datey so we will see how that goes. 
i borrowed gaia's jacket which is actually dex's borrowed jacket and it is very warm and nice.

        <p>freedom is cooking in my underwear, the stream we visited today, the way we danced last night, the way we will dance tonight, the way that i feel when im alone. me and polina looked out of the back of the car the whole way there and back. the sun turned the mountains orange then pink then blue. me and rowan watched the mothers lead their children and promised to do the same. she found a dog tag with her daughters name on it a couple steps later. it is all so beautiful and i do not know how to hold it. because every time i try it slips through. like the creek we skipped rocks on. like the wind. the cut on my ankle turned the beads of my anklet pink. and i listened so hard to the sound of the forest knowing. and i read the poem i wrote a year ago twice. trying to make sense of all the missing. she drew me in the window frost. i drank tea from my favourite mug. i am trying.</p>

        <p>11:25am: in my bio class. have been thinking and trying my hand at forgiveness and letting go. i find it rlly helps to believe the argument that free will does not exist. so, if i had one's experiences and dna i would act the same way so who am i to judge. it is hard tho because it is always a balance of protecting my peace and forgiveness. 
today i am wearing my jean skirt with my yoga pants under them and rowan's 'babette ate oatmeal' shirt and alice's fur hat. i am trying to forgive for myself mostly. i am tired of wasting energy on the hating and rumination. i am trying to live for now now now but it is so hard. </p>
        <img src="images/gifs/444.gif" alt="catGif">
        <p>1:59pm: have been thinking about the way my mind moves through thoughts like the animal trails i see in the forest. each track is so subtle and barely visible to me but to my mind creatures they are home. although how pretty of an image this is these paths make up a web of loops and spirals that are fairly destructive. i am trying to pave new paths but i am going about it clumsily as humans do.... i am totally 100% procrastinating all of my work by blogging so i must go...

these are the to dos:
- read pages 190-210 of plato's the republic
- bio quiz #1
- bio worksheet #3 
- cpsc assignment final coding Q

i'll let u star people know if i finish them....</p>\
