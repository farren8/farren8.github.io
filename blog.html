        <p>9:50am: happy thursday. my hair is greasy and my body is hurting from my laziness. i dont know what to do. my degree is increasingly boring me and i cannot pay attention in any of my lectures like not even french for god's sake. i wake up late and the apartment is a mess and i should rlly delete twitter. like rlly i cannot do it anymore all the ppl being hateful is rlly grinding my gears or whatever ppl say. i have a bio midterm in 1 hour and i didn't rlly study all that much but i cannot bring myself to care. I DONT KNOW WHATS WRONG WITH ME!!

        <p>4:29pm: hai my ppl. a day can turn around and flip and fly like a seal in the sea. mine just did. not out of some extraordinary moment but of a slow and sure trying on my part. i cleaned my whole house and i am so excited for gaia to get home and see the kitchen clean. she deserves so much she is working so hard. i just remembered that johnny cash wrote "a girl in saskatoon" and i listend to it 3 times. i also remembered how much i love cat power like i love her so much i want to kiss her soul and gobble up all her songs. anyways i am going to the bar tn but im rlly just looking forward to coming home and laying in my clean sheets. and maybe having some tea and reading the book gaia gave me. tomorrow i need to do one million billion hours of school which is ok. it is ok. i will be ok. 
p.s. i got a new agenda #freshstart #springcleaning or something like that.
p.p.s. check out this song: 'lived in bars' by cat power</p>

        <p>in french class. the cat came back yesterday and she brought me smiles and sunshine. i slept through my philosophy class this morning. wrote in my journal on the bus and saw an old friend. these are the days for new and old friends. and when im looking at my feet sunlight trickles into the bus and strokes my face and arms. the spring lifts my cheeks into a smile and i smile.

        <p>11:46am - in bio class. i saw marcus macgregor td. he gave me "Found Any Shoggoths Yet?", brought up some good points but the song he recommended isn't my jam. 
5:01pm - met this girl i have met a million times before but cannot ever remember her name. then when she said it AGAIN i said 'eiko! like ecco2k!!!' and she did not get it. sad moment. i talked to my mum freaking out about my future and my major earlier td. that was fun. i am going to hangout with my new friend (??!) and it is feeling very datey so we will see how that goes. 
i borrowed gaia's jacket which is actually dex's borrowed jacket and it is very warm and nice.

        <p>freedom is cooking in my underwear, the stream we visited today, the way we danced last night, the way we will dance tonight, the way that i feel when im alone. me and polina looked out of the back of the car the whole way there and back. the sun turned the mountains orange then pink then blue. me and rowan watched the mothers lead their children and promised to do the same. she found a dog tag with her daughters name on it a couple steps later. it is all so beautiful and i do not know how to hold it. because every time i try it slips through. like the creek we skipped rocks on. like the wind. the cut on my ankle turned the beads of my anklet pink. and i listened so hard to the sound of the forest knowing. and i read the poem i wrote a year ago twice. trying to make sense of all the missing. she drew me in the window frost. i drank tea from my favourite mug. i am trying.</p>

        <p>11:25am: in my bio class. have been thinking and trying my hand at forgiveness and letting go. i find it rlly helps to believe the argument that free will does not exist. so, if i had one's experiences and dna i would act the same way so who am i to judge. it is hard tho because it is always a balance of protecting my peace and forgiveness. 
today i am wearing my jean skirt with my yoga pants under them and rowan's 'babette ate oatmeal' shirt and alice's fur hat. i am trying to forgive for myself mostly. i am tired of wasting energy on the hating and rumination. i am trying to live for now now now but it is so hard. </p>
        <img src="images/gifs/444.gif" alt="catGif">
        <p>1:59pm: have been thinking about the way my mind moves through thoughts like the animal trails i see in the forest. each track is so subtle and barely visible to me but to my mind creatures they are home. although how pretty of an image this is these paths make up a web of loops and spirals that are fairly destructive. i am trying to pave new paths but i am going about it clumsily as humans do.... i am totally 100% procrastinating all of my work by blogging so i must go...

these are the to dos:
- read pages 190-210 of plato's the republic
- bio quiz #1
- bio worksheet #3 
- cpsc assignment final coding Q

i'll let u star people know if i finish them....</p>

        <p>in forestry with my girl alexie rn. we are going to the ivanhoe tonight for beer and karoake and pool and i am euphoric. yesterday i went climbing and did a hatha yoga class and on the way home hit up nofrills. i then made a quinoa salad and ate a whole carton of strawberries with whipped cream while watching 'crazy stupid love' with ryan gosling and emma stone (HOT!). it was a good day.

peace and love my star people!!
